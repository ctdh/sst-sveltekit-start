### Root Directory (/)

This is the root of your SvelteKit application. It typically contains configuration files like svelte.config.js, package.json, .gitignore, and any other configuration files necessary for your project (like tsconfig.json for TypeScript).

### Source Directory (/src)

This is the main source directory for your SvelteKit application. It contains all the Svelte components, libraries, and assets that make up your application.

### Library Directory (/src/lib)

This directory is used for storing reusable Svelte components or JavaScript modules. It's a convention in SvelteKit to keep your shared components and utility functions here.

### Stores Directory (/src/lib/stores)

This is a subdirectory within /lib specifically for Svelte stores. Svelte stores are used for managing app-wide state. Keeping them in a separate stores directory helps with organization, especially as your application grows.

### Routes Directory (/src/routes)

This directory contains your SvelteKit pages and endpoints. The file structure within this directory directly maps to your application's routing.

### Static Directory (/src/static)

This directory is for static assets that should not be processed by SvelteKit. These might include images, fonts, and other static files. They are served as-is from the root URL.

### Tests Directory (/src/tests)

This directory is for your test files. It's good practice to have a separate directory for tests to keep them organized and separate from your application code.

### Components Directory (/src/components)

For larger projects, you might want to separate your reusable Svelte components from other library code. This directory would be specifically for those components.

### Hooks Directory (/src/hooks)

If you're using SvelteKit hooks (like handle, getSession, etc.), you might want to organize them into a separate directory for clarity.

### Utils Directory (/src/utils)

For utility functions or helper modules that are used across different components or routes.

### Types Directory (/src/types)

A directory for TypeScript type definitions, especially for types that are used across different components or modules
